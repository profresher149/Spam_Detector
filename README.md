# Spam_Detector
Overview:
This project implements a machine learning model for spam detection in emails using a Random Forest Classifier. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the model is trained to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham).

Dataset:
The dataset can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset. 

Usage:
Download the dataset from Kaggle.
Ensure Python dependencies (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy) are installed.
Execute the provided Jupyter Notebook (spam_detection.ipynb) for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Utilize the trained model to classify new email data.

Conclusion:
This project showcases the application of machine learning, specifically Random Forest Classifier, in automating spam detection, contributing to enhanced email security and user experience. Further optimizations can be explored for improved model performance and adaptability to diverse email datasets.
